    "# Objective:-\n",
    "#     In this project, I developed a Flipkart price tracker and email notification system using Python and its modules.\n",
    "#     The objective was to showcase my Python programming skills and proficiency in utilizing relevant modules for web \n",
    "#     scraping, data manipulation, and email automation.\n",
    "    \n",
    "# Data Collection and Storage:-\n",
    "#     Utilized web scraping techniques with libraries like BeautifulSoup and Requests to extract product details such as name \n",
    "#     and price from Flipkart's product pages. \n",
    "#     Implemented an automated data collection mechanism to periodically fetch the  latest prices and store them in a file.\n",
    "#     Created a well-structured file format, such as CSV, to store the product details along with the corresponding prices.\n",
    "    \n",
    "    \n",
    "# Data Processing and Comparison:-\n",
    "#     Developed a Python script to read the data from website and stored them in file .\n",
    "#     Utilized data manipulation techniques using modules like pandas to perform efficient and effective price comparisons.\n",
    "#     Implemented algorithms to identify when the latest price is lower than the previous prices.\n",
    "    \n",
    "    \n",
    "# Scheduling task and Email Notification System:-\n",
    "#     Set up an automation mechanism,  Task Scheduler on Windows, to run the price tracking and email notification script at regular intervals.\n",
    "#     Integrated the project with the email functionality to send notifications when the latest price is lower than the \n",
    "#     previous prices.   \n",
    "    \n",
    "# Error Handling and Robustness:-\n",
    "#     Implemented error handling techniques to handle exceptions and errors that may occur during web scraping, data processing, or email sending.\n",
    "#     Ensured the system's robustness by handling edge cases, such as network connectivity issues, invalid data, or email delivery failures.\n",
    "    \n",
    "\n",
    "# Testing and Validation:\n",
    "#     Performed rigorous testing to ensure the accuracy and correctness of the price tracking and email notification system.\n",
    "#     Conducted validation tests using sample data and edge cases to verify the system's functionality and reliability.\n",
